Hi! I'm currently a junior student at [Anhui University](https://www.ahu.edu.cn/), enrolled in the [School of Internet](https://si.ahu.edu.cn/), where I'm pursuing a major in **Data Science and Big Data Technology**. This journey has not only honed my technical skills but also ignited a passion for delving into complex data realms.

My academic pursuits are anchored in the study of **nonlinear systems**, **graph neural networks**, and **knowledge graphs**. These areas are particularly captivating to me, as they unravel the intricate patterns and connections within vast datasets. My exploratory spirit doesn't stop here, though; I am always keen to dive into diverse topics within data science and embrace new challenges.

If you're navigating similar waters or simply wish to exchange thoughts on the ever-evolving landscape of technology, I'd love to connect. There's nothing more enriching than sharing insights and fueling our collective curiosity in this dynamic field!

Research Interests
======
- **Nonlinear Systems**: My research focuses on applying fractional-order differential equations in infectious disease modeling, enhancing predictive analytics in public health.

- **Graph Neural Networks**: I explore the use of graph neural networks for financial data analysis, extending to areas like market trend prediction and financial network analysis.

- **Knowledge Graphs**: I specialize in developing knowledge graphs for the financial sector, aiming to improve decision-making with a focus on a project called “GraphFinAl,” similar to ChatGPT but tailored for finance.
