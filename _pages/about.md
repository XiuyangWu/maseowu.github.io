Hi! I'm currently a junior student at Anhui University, enrolled in the School of Internet, where I'm pursuing a major in Data Science and Big Data Technology. This journey has not only honed my technical skills but also ignited a passion for delving into complex data realms.

My academic pursuits are anchored in the study of nonlinear systems, graph neural networks, and knowledge graphs. These areas are particularly captivating to me, as they unravel the intricate patterns and connections within vast datasets. My exploratory spirit doesn't stop here, though; I am always keen to dive into diverse topics within data science and embrace new challenges.

If you're navigating similar waters or simply wish to exchange thoughts on the ever-evolving landscape of technology, I'd love to connect. There's nothing more enriching than sharing insights and fueling our collective curiosity in this dynamic field!
